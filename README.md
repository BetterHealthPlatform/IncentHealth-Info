Proposal for Blockchain Hackathon for Social Impact
Ethereum-based platform for improving health behavior through incentives and providing new healthcare payment mechanisms for underserved markets.

In healthcare management, a combination of massive inefficiencies and misaligned incentive structures are contributing to higher costs for the economy and poorer health outcomes, particularly for underserved demographics (e.g. unbanked/underbanked). Specifically, our test pilot in smoking is a leading cause of deaths in the U.S. Smoking contributes to higher insurance premiums, increased insurance claims, and negative externalities associated with second hand effects. These sore points call for a blockchain-based platform to improve population health through incentivization and providing new healthcare payment mechanisms for underserved markets.

Smart contracts allow verified parties to enter into an agreement whereby payments are made from the donor wallet to the smart contract wallet, which is then paid out to the patient wallet upon verification of health goals.
