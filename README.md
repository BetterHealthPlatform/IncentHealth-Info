# IncentHealth
Prototype Submitted to Blockchain Hackathon for Social Impact
Ethereum-based platform for improving health behavior through incentives and providing new healthcare payment mechanisms for underserved markets.

Financial inclusion and healthy choices are vital to an individual’s well-being. Yet 2 billion people worldwide do not have access to basic financial services, while 400 million individuals do not have access to essential health services. Healthcare systems are bogged down with inefficiencies, data silos, and misaligned incentives. A strong driver of growing healthcare costs are preventable diseases, which can be largely avoided with better lifestyle choices.

IncentHealth’s mission: aim to improve health behavior through incentives and provides new payment mechanisms for underserved markets.

A multifaceted incentive design--inspired by clinical trials--rewards patients with crypto tokens for meeting health goals.
Participants can choose different incentive arrangements, including a financial reward versus a deposit contract. 

Incentives create a positive network effect by encouraging longer term patient-caretaker participation, while addressing the difficulty of first-time onboarding. Tokens can be used to pay for health services, as well as non-health goods. 

Smart contracts allow verified parties to enter into an agreement whereby payments are made from the donor wallet to the smart contract wallet, which is then paid out to the patient wallet upon verification of health goals.
